# Google Books Search

### Future Development Work

- Set up components for search & save button, search input field and a container that displays information for 2 different pages. One for Saved searches and one for displaying results from Google API

- Set up back-end API to google Books - which is a Fetch request that triggers on search and displays information on the container div component

- Set up Database with Mongoose and set up the save button such that it saves the results to your local database.

- ReDeploy with Heroku and set up environment variables for the Database
